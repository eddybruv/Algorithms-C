/** 
 * A linked list is a data structure used for storing data. A linked list has the following properties:
    - Successive elements are connected by pointers.
    - The last element points to NULL.
    - Can grow or shrink in size during program execution.
    - Can be made as long as needed. (Until system memory exhausts).
    - Doesnâ€™t waste memory space but takes some extra memory for pointers. It allocates memory as it grows.

    int value;                 //what is being stored in the list
    struct Node *next_node;    //pointer to the next node in the list
